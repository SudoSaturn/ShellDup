            Help: "The window to match. Match specifications are of the form: :italic:`field:query`. Where :italic:`field` can be one of: :code:`id`, :code:`title`, :code:`pid`, :code:`cwd`, :code:`cmdline`, :code:`num`, :code:`env`, :code:`var`, :code:`state`, :code:`neighbor`, :code:`session` and :code:`recent`. :italic:`query` is the expression to match. Expressions can be either a number or a regular expression, and can be :ref:`combined using Boolean operators <search_syntax>`.\n\nThe special value :code:`all` matches all windows.\n\nFor numeric fields: :code:`id`, :code:`pid`, :code:`num` and :code:`recent`, the expression is interpreted as a number, not a regular expression. Negative values for :code:`id` match from the highest id number down, in particular, -1 is the most recently created window.\n\nThe field :code:`num` refers to the window position in the current tab, starting from zero and counting clockwise (this is the same as the order in which the windows are reported by the :ref:`kitten @ ls <at-ls>` command).\n\nThe window id of the current window is available as the :envvar:`KITTY_WINDOW_ID` environment variable.\n\nThe field :code:`recent` refers to recently active windows in the currently active tab, with zero being the currently active window, one being the previously active window and so on.\n\nThe field :code:`neighbor` refers to a neighbor of the active window in the specified direction, which can be: :code:`left`, :code:`right`, :code:`top` or :code:`bottom`.\n\nThe field :code:`session` matches windows that were created in the specified session. Use the expression :code:`^$` to match windows that were not created in a session and :code:`.` to match the currently active session and :code:`~` to match either the currently active sesison or the last active session when no session is active.\n\nWhen using the :code:`env` field to match on environment variables, you can specify only the environment variable name or a name and value, for example, :code:`env:MY_ENV_VAR=2`.\n\nSimilarly, the :code:`var` field matches on user variables set on the window. You can specify name or name and value as with the :code:`env` field.\n\nThe field :code:`state` matches on the state of the window. Supported states are: :code:`active`, :code:`focused`, :code:`needs_attention`, :code:`parent_active`, :code:`parent_focused`, :code:`self`, :code:`overlay_parent`.  Active windows are the windows that are active in their parent tab. There is only one focused window and it is the window to which keyboard events are delivered. If no window is focused, the last focused window is matched. The value :code:`self` matches the window in which the remote control command is run. The value :code:`overlay_parent` matches the window that is under the :code:`self` window, when the self window is an overlay.\n\nNote that you can use the :ref:`kitten @ ls <at-ls>` command to get a list of windows.",
