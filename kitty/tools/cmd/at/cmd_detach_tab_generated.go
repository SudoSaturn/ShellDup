Negative values for :code:`id`/:code:`window_id` match from the highest id number down, in particular, -1 is the most recently created tab/window.\n\nWhen using :code:`title` or :code:`id`, first a matching tab is looked for, and if not found a matching window is looked for, and the tab for that window is used.\n\nYou can also use :code:`window_id` and :code:`window_title` to match the tab that contains the window with the specified id or title.\n\nThe :code:`index` number is used to match the nth tab in the currently active OS window.
